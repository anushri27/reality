        <h3>What is Overfishing?</h3>
        <p>Overfishing occurs when marine life is caught at a faster rate than it can be replenished. In other words, it is unsustainable and will cause eventual endangerment of species.
        <br/><br/>  Many governments still continue to subsidize their fleets, allowing unprofitable operations to subsist, and overfishing to occur. 
        increasing fishing efforts over the last 50 years as well as unsustainable fishing practices are pushing many fish stocks to the point of collapse
        <br/><br/> One particular type of fishing, bottom-trawling, is blamed for some of the worst and unnecessary damage. It involves dropping a large net, around 60 meters-wide in some cases, into the sea and dragging it along with heavy weights from a trawler. 
        <br/> The bycatch, unwanted fish and other ocean life thrown back into the sea, can amount to as much as 90% of a trawl's total catch.
        <br/> <br/>

        <h3>This is happening right now!!</h3>
        <p> Tens of thousands of bluefin tuna were caught every year in the North Sea in the 1930s and 1940s. Today, they have disappeared across the seas of Northern Europe. <br/> <br/>
        The ocean has become 30% more acidic since the start of The Industrial Revolution in the 18th century and is predicted to be 150% more acidic by the end of this century, according to a UNESCO report published last year. <br/> <br/>
        A 2015 study showed nearly 500 Chinese fishing vessels operating off west Africa, with scores of cases of illegal fishing, according to Greenpeace. Large European vessels also operate in the region. In April 2015, the EU threatened to take reprecussions. <br/> <br/>
        The problem is that most of the world's ocean is located outside of international law and legal control. Any attempts to implement rules and regulation come with the problem of enforcement, says Rogers, who is also scientific director of the International Program on State of the Ocean (IPSO).

        <h3>I've never heard of Coral Bleaching. Explain please!</h3>
        <p>When water is too warm, corals will expel the algae (zooxanthellae) living in their tissues causing the coral to turn completely white. <br/> BUT when a coral bleaches, it is not dead. Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to mortality. 
        <br/><br/>
        Reefs make up less than 1 percent of Earth's undersea ecosystems, but don't underestimate their importance:
          <li> They shelter 25 percent of marine species </li>
          <li> Protect shorelines </li>
          <li> Support fishing industries </li> 
          <li> Provide tourist dollars </li> 
          <li> It could even be home to the next big undiscovered medical breakthrough </li> <br/>

        <h3>Are our coral dying now?</h3>
        <p>Nearly all of the world's major coral reef regions (Caribbean/ western Atlantic, eastern Pacific, central and western Pacific, Indian Ocean, Arabian Gulf, Red Sea) experienced some degree of coral bleaching and mortality during the 1980s. <br/> <br/>

        In 2005, the U.S. lost half of its coral reefs in the Caribbean in one year due to a massive bleaching event. The warm waters centered around the northern Antilles near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico expanded southward. Furthermore, in January 2010, cold water temperatures in the Florida Keys caused a coral bleaching event that resulted in some coral death. Water temperatures dropped 12.06 degrees Fahrenheit lower than the typical temperatures observed at this time of year. <br/> <br/>

        More than 60 coral reef bleaching events out of 105 mass coral moralities were reported between 1979-1990, compared with only three bleaching events among 63 mass coral moralities recorded during the preceding 103 years. <br/>

        <p>Though the main problem that leads to the coral reef bleaching is due to climate change and warmer oceans, there are many thing that you can do to help! Start off with this following list: 
        <li>Support reef-friendly businesses. Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs. This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs. Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs.</li>
        <li>When you visit a coral reef, help keep it healthy by respecting all local guidelines, recommendations, regulations, and customs.</li>
        <li>Keep it clean. You may be in the habit of picking up your own trash. You may even participate in an organized cleanup.</li>
        <li>Be an informed consumer. Consider carefully the coral objects that you buy for your coffee table. Ask the store owner or manager from what country the coral is taken and whether or not that country has a management plan to insure that the harvest was legal and sustainable over time.</li>

        <h3>What is Deforestation?</h3>
        <p>Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests in order to make the land available for other uses. While deforestation occurs around the world, tropical rainforests are particularly targeted.
        <br/><br/>
        Forests are cut down for many reasons, but most of them are related to money or to people's need to provide for their families.The biggest driver of deforestation is agriculture. Farmers cut forests to provide more room for planting crops or grazing livestock. Often many small farmers will each clear a few acres to feed their families by cutting down trees and burning them in a process known as "slash and burn" agriculture.
        <br/><br/> Deforestation has many negative effects on the environment. The most dramatic impact is a loss of habitat for millions of species. Seventy percent of Earth’s land animals and plants live in forests, and many cannot survive the deforestation that destroys their homes.
        <br/><br/>
        Removing trees deprives the forest of portions of its canopy, which blocks the sun's rays during the day and holds in heat at night. This disruption leads to more extreme temperatures swings that can be harmful to plants and animals. <br/> 
        Trees also play a critical role in absorbing the greenhouse gases that fuel global warming. Fewer forests means larger amounts of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere and increased speed and severity of global warming.

        <h3>What's going on now?</h3>
        <p><span style="color: red;">A LOT! </span> </p>
        An estimated 18 million acres (7.3 million hectares) of forest, which is roughly the size of the country of Panama, are lost each year, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). <br/>c
        About half of the world's tropical forests have been cleared (FAO) <br/>
        Forests currently cover about 30 percent of the world’s land mass (National Geographic)<br/>
        Forest loss contributes between 6 percent and 12 percent of annual global carbon dioxide emissions (Nature Geoscience)<br/>
        About 36 football fields worth of trees lost every minute (World Wildlife Fund (WWF))<br/><br/>
        But not everything is bad! Take Mexico for example, <br/>
        A small group in Mexico noticed an excessive amount of their forest being but down. Living in a rural village, they are dependent on the wood in the forest. But they were able to come up with a solution! They released 1000's of fireflies into their forests as a way to attract tourists (said to be a 'chirstmas in the forest'), stop companies from cutting down their wood and sustaining their land. Though they still need to cut down trees for themselves, it is at a renewable rate! Way to go Mexico! <br/><br/>

        <p>So what can you do about deforestation? <br/><br/>
        One easy way to combat deforestation is to plant a tree. But you can take it one step further by making sure the choices you make at home, at the store, at work, and on the menu don’t contribute to the problem. Here’s what you can do about deforestation.

        <li>Plant a tree.</li>
        <li>Go paperless.</li>
        <li>Recycle and buy recycled products.</li>
        <li>Look for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification on wood and wood products.</li>
        <li>Eat vegetarian meals as often as possible.</li>

        <h3>What is Fracking?</h3>
        <p> Fracking fluid is born when tons of water is mixed with tons of chemicals including methane, mercury, and lead.  Fracking fluid is put to work as it gets pushed through pipelines underground.  The fracking fluid is so strong and undergoes so much pressure that it makes big fractures in shale rock.  The new cracks in the ground allow natural gas to flow up to the surface where it is collected.  Once the fracking fluid’s work is done, it is ready to go back to the wastewater disposal well.  While traveling back, some of the fracking fluid loses its way and finds itself into clean groundwater.
        <br/><br/>
        The little fracking fluid that is able to get back to the surface safely is no longer needed and is dumped into a toxic pit that sits out in the sun.  Its life comes to an end due to evaporation.  The fracking fluid evaporates making its way up to Heaven.  On its way up, it harms the atmosphere by making the earth really hot, causing global warming.

        <h3>This is horrible! Is it still going on?</h3>
        <p>Recently, Texas had a wave of earthquakes, and at one point there were about 11 earthquakes in the span of 24 hours! This is not normal for Texas, which is not near a sesmic plate. So what else could be causing this severe disruption?
        <br/> <br/>
        Unforunately, this was cause by the byproducts of human induced hydraulic fracking called "flowback water." 
        <br/><br/> "While some uncertainties remain, it is unlikely that natural increases to tectonic stresses led to these events," head researcher Heather DeShon of SMU wrote in his report.
        They were able to link the earthquakes to the hydraulic activity because of a "first of a kind" modeling study that "allowed the SMU team to move beyond assessment of possible causes to the most likely cause identified in this report," it said.
        <br/><br/>This new data helps clarify the locations of the faults that are the sources of the earthquakes, SMU geophysicist Brian Stump said.

        <p> Since most of the fracking is started and executed by large energy companies, it is imporatnt that one of your first steps be to contact them and stand up agaisnt this harmful activity. Petitioning or having peaceful protests could influence the companies enough for them to stop what they are doing. <br/><br/>
        There are many website's out there that have already started groups for protests and petitions, and each contribution counts, so make sure that your voice is heard! <br/><br/>
        Additionally, support groups such as Earth Justice, that help reduce fracking and talk to the governement officals as a way to take a stand.

        <h3>I hear about climate change, but what it is?</h3>
        <p> Though climate change is a natural process, humans and our actions have sped up the process by a tenfold because of our increase in air pollution, use of non-renewable resources, and alteration of biodiversity. 
        <br/><br/>
        According to the report, Preparing for a Changing Climate, rising levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere have warmed the Earth and are causing wide-ranging impacts, including rising sea levels; melting snow and ice; more extreme heat events, fires and drought; and more extreme storms, rainfall and floods.

        <h3>It's effecting the whole world!</h3>
        <p> Just taking one example, as temperatures rise around the world, African deserts have been hit hard. With the temperature hotter than ever, there are signs that the hot desert storms have increased the risk of bacterial meningitis in the continent. This is mostly due to the increased exposure to the dust. Many studies have shown that the most outbreaks over the last 8 years occurred after sandstorms or excessively high temperatures. <br/><br/>
        According to the US National Academy of Sciences, over the past 30 years, there has been a fourfold increase in the number of large and long-duration forest fires in the American West. The length of the fire season has expanded by 2.5 months, and the size of wildfires has increased several times over. More than half the US Western states have experienced their largest wildfire on record since 2000.
        <br/><br/>
<!--         Another event that is severely effecting our planet is the melting of the polar ice caps. With the increase in the ocean temperatures near the equator and the consequent travel of that water from the middle of the world to the pole are taking a toll on the ice and life on the poles.

        <h3>How can you help?</h3>
        <p> There are many things that an individual can do in order to help to fight climate change, and each of the first steps start with your individual self! 
        <li> Try and save as much energy as you can. <br/>
        That means around the house, at world or at school. Switch off lights, turn off the gas, and unplug devices from the socket when they are fully charged.</li>
        <li> Plant as many trees as you can! <br/>
        Natural air purifiers, people!</li>
        <li>Become a vegeraian! <br/>
        You don't understand how much harmful gasses come from livestock that goes directly to our atmosphere. Check it out:  </li>
          <img src="climate6.jpg" style="width:350px;">
        <li>Last but not least, reuse, renew, recycle! <br/>
        This is very important. Keeping things out of the landfills will reduce their load and therefore the acidic waste from your trash won't leak into our oceans. While this may not seem like you are doing too much, with everyone making a difference, we can save the world!</li>
