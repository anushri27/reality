        <h3>What is Police Brutality?</h3>
        <p>According to the Law Dictionary, police brutality “is the use of excessive and/or 
        unnecessary force by police when dealing with civilians”. The major debate in media 
        now is the fact that “excessive and/or unnecessary force” is a subjective term and could 
        be interpreted differently between the victim and the officer. Many times there are 
        accusations that police brutality differs by the race and gender of the victim, as 
        African Americans and Middle Eastern men seem to be seeing the worst of the police. <br><br>
		Police brutality has been a problem from the times of the Industrial revolution, and 
		we have had spikes of severe brutality after major attacks, such as that of 9/11.

        <h3>Recent Events</h3>
        <p> Though there are dash cams on the police car as well as body cams on the officer themselves, 
        there has been many instances in court where the video has been altered, or the officer him/herself 
        would turn off the camera in order to eradicate evidence. <br><br>
        On August 1st, 2016, there was a case where a Chicago police officer shot and killed an African American 
        18 year old after he crashed a stolen car. Though spectators saw the event, the police’s body camera was 
        not working during that instance -- something that many people at his court case was suspicious about, 
        as they thought it was just his attempt at a cover up. Eventually, this officer was suspended from his job, 
        but the life of the young man who he killed will never be revived.

        <p>If you see police brutality wrongly committed, make sure that you take action and make 
        it a point to report the accident and all the witnesses on the scene. The same would apply if you 
        yourself are the victim.  Also take pictures of the injuries on the victim and if possible take a 
        video of the police as a way of solid evidence.

        <h3>What is Gender Inequality?</h3>
        <p>Gender inequality is defined as the imbalance in status between men and women.  While women have gained many more freedoms in the last 100,  
        years, some women still experience sexism, even in the United States.
        <br/><br/>
        Women have caught up to, and in some countries, even surpass men in terms of education, but discrimination still exists in the workplace.
        Wage discrimination occurs when equally qualified workers who produce the same amount of work get paid different amounts. Historically
        speaking, men were paid more than equally qualified women; gender pay gaps persist around the world. According to the International 
        Labour Organization, on average, American women make 81% of their male counterparts earned.  Additionally, women made up 24% of CEOs
        in the United States, but only earned 74.5% as much as male CEOs.

        <p>Actresses Alysia Reiner and Sarah Morgan Thomas recently founded the company Broad Street Pictures aimed to fight
        against gender inequality in Hollywood.  They want to tell entertaining and though provoking stories about amazing
        women.  "Equity" is their first movie that premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival.  The movie stars Anna Gunn and 
        about an investment banker who is caught in a web of scandal and corruption. <br> <br>
    	Borad Street Pictures wants to create more opportunities for women to close the gender gap in the film industry by putting
    	more women in front and behind the camera. The company is still in its beginning stages and is being run out Reiner's and Thomas's
    	apartments, but they hope to make big strides for women.</p>

        <h3>What is Gun Violence?</h3>
        <p>Current legislation allows Americans to own guns and use them for recreational purposes and to defend against and deter acts of violence 
        Each year tens of thousands of people are injured and killed by firearms. Gun violence occurs most commonly in lower income areas and are frequently associated with gang violence. The media
        highlights many of the mass shooting incidents, but mass shootings account for only a small fraction of gun related violence.  
        Between 1994 and 2007, the frequency of these incidents declined, but has been rising from 2007 to 2016.  
		<br><br>
		There have been many attempts to reduce gun violence through legislation including restricting the purchase of firearms from youths,
		establishing stricter background checks, and stiffening the sentencing of gun law violators.

        <p>On Sunday July 31, a gunman fired into a crowd of people in downtown Austin at 2:15 a.m., killing one woman and leaving four others
        seriously injured.  Police were able to identify the gunman as 24 year old Endicott McCray, but his whereabouts remained unknown.
        McCray had previously done time in jail on two separate counts for robbery and possession of a firearm.  Austin Police Chief
        Art Acevdeo assured the public that Austin is one of the safest cities in the country despite the incident on Sunday.

        <h3>What We Can Do</h3>
        <p>To eliminate gun violence in the United States, we can first make more restrictions on gun sales.  Current legislation allows 
        people with criminal records and mental illnesses to purchase guns.  Another major step would be to improve the health care
        system. By improving treatment, we would reduce the chance for people with mental health issues from becoming violent. We could 
        also address the illegal sale of firearms. With new legislation, it would be easier to track guns and where they are coming from.
        Lastly, more research on gun violence could be conducted. Funding for this research would be able to answer a lot of questions about
        the recent rise in gun violence that would help stop future gun violence incidents.

        <h3>What is Animal Abuse?</h3>
        <p>Dog fighting is one of the most heinous forms of animal cruelty. Fighting dogs are 
        typically raised in isolation, so they spend most of their lives on short, heavy chains. 
        They are regularly conditioned for fighting through the use of drugs, including anabolic 
        steroids to enhance muscle mass and encourage aggressiveness. Fighting dogs may have their 
        ears cropped and tails docked close to their bodies to minimize the animal’s normal body 
        language cues and to limit areas that another dog can grab during a fight. Fighters usually 
        perform this cropping/docking themselves using crude and inhumane techniques.
        <br><br>
		Puppy mills usually house dogs in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions without adequate 
		veterinary care, food, water or socialization. In order to maximize profits, female dogs are bred
 		at every opportunity with little-to-no recovery time between litters. Puppy mill puppies, often 
 		as young as eight weeks of age, are sold to pet shops or directly to the public over the Internet, 
 		through newspaper ads and at swap meets and flea markets.

        <h3>What is Nativism?</h3>
        <p>Nativism is the political policy of favoring a group of established citizens of a country over 
        immigrants. In history, there was a large rise in nativism in the 1920s; many new immigrants
        were moving to the United States, and many Americans feared that new comers would ruin American
        values and take from their resources. This fear prompted groups like the Ku Klux Klan to emerge 
        and laws that set limitations on immigration to be put into place.<br><br>
        In recent years, the Tea Party has redirected their attention to stopping any laws that would
        grant illegals in the U.S. citizenship. Republican candidate for the 2016 election, Donald Trump
        spoke about nativist themes that targeted Muslims and Mexicans.

        Even if nativism isn't directly effecting you, other groups need to be considered. Voting
        for political candidates who support the equality of people regardless of their backgrounds.
        Lastly, you can encourage laws that combat xenophobia and allow the country to advance towards
        a more equal society.
