You think they read your body language because they put their hands up and back up a step. <br> 'Listen, I know you must be extremely confused right now, but let me explain. I'm not looking to hurt you. The only reason you're here is because when your machine crashed next to where I was taking samples. I couldn't just leave you there, you see?

You have a few burning questions. <br> 'Okay right, I guess I should thank you. Thanks, really. But, where is my machine now? And what were you taking samples of? Who are you?' <br>'You're machine crashed right in front of me, you were deposited onto the soil in a protective shell that disappeared along with the machine. It's gone now. I was taking samples of the soil, there used to be a huge fracking operation nearby and the groundwater was inevitably contaminated with chemicals like methane, mercury, and lead. I'm trying to see if this world has recovered at all from the recklessness of our ancestors,' they explain and settle into a nearby duct taped folding chair. You're left reeling from the permanence of your situation without your time machine, but the fracking catastrophe isn't lost on you, how could energy companies could be so shortsighted to think that the benefits of natural gas collection be worth the slew of environmental dangers created by fracking? You shake your head solemnly; how could we have let it get so bad? There's one other question though..<br>'Alright..but this is nothing like the future that I imagined, why are you living so humbly?' <br> You heard your host chuckle, 'That, oh traveler, is a quite a story. One I'd be happy to tell you, but maybe give me some reassurance here that you're not a mad woman that will kill me in my sleep? I've brought you into my home and I have no idea who you are or if you pose a threat to me. You teleported here, for god's sake! I'm endlessly curious. Where did you come from?' <br> You explain everything and they are astounded. They ask a million questions and you try to fill them in as much as you can. As the discussion lengthens, you notice the pitch of your host's voice getting higher, you can't help but ask, 'Hey, if this is an invasive question then you don't feel pressured to answer, I'll drop it immediately, but..are you a girl?' They start, cough, and when they speak again their voice is back to the deep tone they had originally. They stand up and you're afraid you've crossed a serious line and are about to profusely apologize, but they speak before you can get the chance. <br>'To answer that, we'll need to go on a walk.' They hold out their hand to help you up. <br> 'Could I ask just one more thing before we go?' They wait expectantly. 'What can I call you?' <br>That elicits another chuckle from your host.
